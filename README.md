# FoodiesParadise

International Bites was designed as a region based recipe search app.

Upon selecting a country the user is taken to a page where they can view a selection of recipes from that reigon.
Once the user has found a recipe they are interested in they can view the recipe on a larger screen for cooking.
The user also has the option to invite their friends over to enjoy the meal with them using Google's Calendar API.


This visuals for this project was designed using materialize.
